"Market Outlook"
""
"Good evening all!! Another week in the markets ahead of us. Last week had some green early in the"
"week, and then on Thursday and Friday we started to see signs of bearishness again. On $SPY, we held"
"solid on Friday off the daily 200sma and finished with a bit of chop. As of now, future data is showing"
"flat. I’m expecting big moves early this week that will decide whether we are green or red overall. I will"
"giving most of my attention this week to one level on $SPY: that is $440. This is roughly where the"
"200sma is, along with strong previous support/resistance levels. A close below this on the daily chart,"
"and I’ll be loading up on puts. Key Levels on $SPY: Support – 443.50, 440.00, 435.75. Resistance –"
"453.50, 457.00, 463.50"

"Weekly Watchers"

"Top Watcher of the Week: Last week, XELA was a great top watcher for us, and it should be strong"
"again this week. This week, I’m eyeing a new target that could have potentially even more gains for us."
"PHUN is setting up for a really nice breakout on the 1-hour chart and couple that with Bitcoin finally"
"getting a nice move (which we will dive into more). This makes for huge potential as our top watcher."
"That chart shows that if we can get close above 2.60 on the hour chart, we should have room to move"
"up to $3+. There has also been a noticeable amount of bullish momentum in favor of PHUN, so we"
"should see continuation. Current Price: 2.54 PT: 2.85, 3.00, 3.20+"

"MidCaps to Watch:"
""
"APP: (long-term add) APP is a relatively new stock to the market, as it IPO’ed back in the spring of 2021."
"With a low of 49 and a high of 116 and strong initial ratings from many analysts, I like getting a starter"
"position on APP. The company helps mobile app developers create and maintain there products. I do"
"think we might be able to get a better price, as APP was up 12% on Friday, but we are seeing a golden"
"cross giving us the perfect entry. Be sure to manage position size here if you are entering with the"
"mindset of long term position. Like I said, we could see a bit of a better entry in the middle of this week."
"Current Price: 68.90 PT: 75.50, 81.00, 90.00+"
""

""
""
"BROS: (Higher-risk, shorter term) BROS is another ticker that has IPO’ed over the past year, but I’m"
"taking this position as potentially a much more active mover. BROS has been seeing abnormally high"
"volume over the past month, pushing it up over a key level at $55. If we can keep holding over this, and"
"get out of the chop level above $60, BROS should really get moving. Current Price: 57.74 PT: 64.00,"
"67.00, 72.50+."

"Top 5 Stock Picks this Week:"
""
""
""
""
"ANY: (Scalp and Swing) ANY was one of the biggest movers from the week last week, in large part to"
"Bitcoin finally breaking out, but also with a price target of $29 and with news of buying out a massive"
"bitcoin farm. This action should continue into this week, and I’m seeing ANY as a solid scalp and swing"
"option. Current Price: 3.10 PT: 3.55, 3.80, 4.10+"
""
"Bitcoin: Speaking of bitcoin, I’ve hinted at it several times in the watchlist so far but we finally broke"
"over the descending level of resistance and are now holding over 40k. This is the first step in reversing"
"the crypto markets, and many other sympathies on the stock market had been following suit late last"
"week like the classic blockchains. As long as bitcoin can hold the 40.5k support level, I see this bullish run"
"continuing in the short term. Next major resistance sitting in the 44-45k range."
""
""
""
""
"INDO: (Scalp Potential) INDO is an energy company that has been hitting the markets strong over the"
"past two weeks with volume. After the initial run int late January, INDO had then settled down and last"
"week put back-to-back very green days together to close the week out. I like the momentum heading"
"into this new week with INDO and would like to see a push back into the $5 range before considering"
"trying to get scalps in. Current Price: 4.88 PT: 5.40, 5.80, 6+"

"DVAX: (Swing Potential) I was on DVAX several weeks back before the markets decided to pull back"
"which sort of killed the initial play, but DVAX really truly never lost it’s form. For the past few months,"
"it’s been sitting in this tight falling wedge that if we can get a break off some catalyst, it should run"
"heavy. It does have potential catalysts in the future with it’s vaccine production. A think a break and"
"close over $13.50 on the daily would confirm a breakout. Current Price: 12.62 PT: 13.90, 15.25, 17.50+"
""
""
""
""
"PFE: (Options / Swing Potential) Pfizer is coming up on earnings this week on Tuesday and it should be"
"interesting. I personally would expect PFE to beat estimates, sending a breakout in motion. The chart"
"shows a really nice consolidation trend over the past two months with significant support between 50-"
"52. With a breakout above the descending level of resistance, along with earnings popping, PFE could be"
"in for a nice ride. Current Price: 53.00 PT: 55.00, 57.00, 60.00+"
